Purpose of Geo-location and why do we need it
- Access current location properties of the user to know more about the user
- The Longitude and Latitude can be used to check current weather info or current situation on the map
- Provide localized content such as local language
- It can be used for targeted advertising 
- Fraud prevention
- It can help you to find your electronic devices if you misplaced them such as Smartphone
- Business owners can take this one step further with geolocation marketing. If you’ve ever used the app Foursquare, you’ll know that as soon as you touch down in a new city, you’ll get a push notification about all the top restaurants near you that match your preferences.
